# LargeNumbersCalculator
Large numbers calculator in Java without using BigDecimal functions.
This is a project developed in the first semesters of the university. It is not intended to optimize the calculations of the operations with Large Numbers, but to saturate the computer's RAM memory looking for a greater decimal precision in the calculation.
